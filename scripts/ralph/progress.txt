# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2026-01-7

## Codebase Patterns
- Solady imports: `import {X} from "solady/path/X.sol";`
- OwnableRoles: Must call `_initializeOwner(msg.sender)` in constructor
- ERC721 metadata: Override `name()`, `symbol()`, `tokenURI()` as abstract

## Key Files
- src/Chimpers.sol - New Chimpers ERC721 collection

---

## 2026-01-07 - US-001
- What was implemented: Chimpers.sol skeleton with ERC721 + OwnableRoles
- Files changed: src/Chimpers.sol (new)
- **Learnings:**
  - Solady ERC721 requires overriding name(), symbol(), tokenURI() as they are abstract
  - OwnableRoles requires calling _initializeOwner() in constructor (no auto-init)
  - LibString.toString() for uint256 to string conversion
